# SVM-Classifier
This repository contains an implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier tailored for analyzing a small dataset. The classifier is designed to test and compare the performance of different kernel types—linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF)—for optimal data separation.
